Overview:
Jonah and I created a collaborative/ competitive game called Synth Blocks. This game entails a collaborative stage in which two users 
(one desktop and one mobile) work together in order to shoot and remove the "bad" cubes from the scene. The desktop user is taksed to 
remain at the center of the scene and remove the blue blocks that hide the smaller yellow blocks.The mobile partner then delete the yellow
cubes. Once all cube have been deleted the collaborative task is complete

The Competitive stage consists of a race against the clock. Each player will take their respectful turn in shooting all yellow blocks as 
fast as they can. Their time in seconds will be recorded and stored into an array in order to display to the player the previous player 
score, hence, satisfying the competitive aspect and replay ability.

Extra work:
-Addition of floating particle library
-Addition of sound and music
-Addition of a blue perspective grid
-re adjust properties of existing grid 
-3 individual title pages
-Addition of counter function
-Addition of alert when task is complete for collaborative and competitive


Challenging:
-Audio was definitly a challenge. the first attempt we made at incorporating sound was successfull and for some odd reason decided to stop working. 
This inheritly made us spend lots of time trouble shooting 

-Socket.IOs communication was definitly challenging to say the least. We had a hard time trouble shooting a problem just to find out an object was 
within and object (data.data portion of code)

Successes:
-Our successes included working as a team and being able to brain storm together and hear out eachothers ideas. 
-Other successes included being able to create and environment in the short amount of time that we did. 
-Once we established the idea we really hit the grown running with the synth theme which helped us create our environment and title pages qickly.

Task seperation:
In terms of task seperation both team members worked on every element together in person which lead to an extreamly collaborative project. 
Both team members completed a significant amount of programming such as; coding for the evironment elements, as well as the actions that 
will be performed in the environment. Additionally, both team members worked on graphical elements such as the Skydome and the title pages.
